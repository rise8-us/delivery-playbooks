Analytics can be enormously helpful for scoping releases, planning iterations, and understanding/improving team norms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use labels and blockers: It is helpful to categorize and sort information using labels or tags. Some backlog tools have specific features for epics and blockers, but in absence of those you can always use labels.</p> </li> <li> <p>Roll up to your roadmap: Your backlog should reflect the outcomes and epics specified on your roadmap as closely as possible in order to minimize surprise work. If a major feature set or refactor pops into your backlog it is probably time to update your roadmap, or vice versa.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A backlog is designed to function as an organization and communication tool for the team, so be open to changing things around and experimenting to make it work as well as possible for your specific team. It is more important for a team to be aligned around a backlog and use it effectively than it is for you to implement your specific style of backlog.

Which makes me feel frustrated and uncertain, and contributes to delayed integrations, higher support ticket volume, and early churn risk. Developer Platforms FedRAMP/ATO-friendly CI I am a federal platform engineer. I\u2019m trying to pass security scans in CI to move toward ATO, but my builds fail on approved runners because there are no STIG-hardened base images or signed SBOMs available. Which makes me feel blocked and anxious about compliance timelines, and contributes to missed delivery milestones and stalled accreditation. Developer Platforms Webhooks reliability in sandbox I am a backend engineer. I\u2019m trying to validate webhooks end-to-end before production, but I can\u2019t reliably replay events because the platform sandbox lacks message retry and an easy tunnel for local testing.

I\u2019m trying to achieve time-to-first-2xx under 30 minutes, but I keep hitting rate limits unexpectedly because default quotas and 429 guidance are undocumented in the quickstart. Which makes me feel confused and stuck, and contributes to false incident escalations and wasted engineering time. Developer Platforms Cross-SDK observability I am an SRE on call. I\u2019m trying to triage an incident quickly, but traces and metrics are inconsistent across official SDKs because they ship different OpenTelemetry versions and naming conventions. Which makes me feel blind during outages, and contributes to longer MTTR and SLO breaches. Dept of Veterans Affairs Post-discharge enrollment I am a recently discharged Veteran.

Which makes me feel embarrassed and neglected, and contributes to missed visits and worsening health outcomes. Dept of State Visa category selection I am a first-time traveler. I\u2019m trying to select the correct visa category, but I often choose the wrong form because eligibility rules are buried in lengthy policy PDFs. Which makes me feel confused and anxious, and contributes to abandoned applications and rework at consulates. Dept of State Emergency passport appointments abroad I am a U.S. citizen abroad. I\u2019m trying to book an emergency passport appointment, but no slots appear for days because there\u2019s no waitlist or auto-reassignment when cancellations occur. Which makes me feel stranded and stressed, and contributes to travel disruptions and hotline overload. Dept of State Cross-system applicant identity I am a consular officer. I\u2019m trying to adjudicate cases efficiently, but I keep encountering duplicate or mismatched records because there is no single applicant identifier across legacy systems.

Developer Platforms SDK Version Drift on Apple Silicon Current Situation: Teams build against our official SDKs on mixed x86/ARM (Apple Silicon) environments.Problem: Version drift and missing ARM build flags in our SDK pipeline cause 18% of builds to fail locally but pass in CI, blocking reliable local development.Actor Effects: Developers waste hours diagnosing environment mismatches; slower release cadence and higher support load for our DX team.Desired Target Results: Bring local build success parity to \u226595% across ARM/x86; publish a deterministic setup script; reduce SDK build-failure tickets by 60% in 90 days. Developer Platforms Unpredictable Rate Limiting Current Situation: Production APIs enforce shared rate limits across endpoints and tenants.Problem: Bursty, undocumented throttling triggers intermittent 429s during partner launches, masking as application errors and stalling go-live windows.Actor Effects: Dev teams implement brittle retries, dashboards show false incident spikes, and launch confidence drops.Desired Target Results: Publish per-endpoint quotas with deterministic headers; keep 429s under 1% of requests during launch weeks; zero Sev-2 incidents caused by rate limits. Dept of Veterans Affairs Claims Delays from External Medical Records Current Situation: Veterans submit disability claims that require records from non-VA providers.Problem: Provider record requests are predominantly fax-based and fail silently, adding a median 19-day delay to claims development.Actor Effects: Veterans experience longer time to decision and repeat outreach; VA staff rework increases; appeals risk rises.Desired Target Results: Reduce external record retrieval median time to \u22645 days via digital requests; improve first-pass decision rate by +20%; cut claims &gt;30-day development holds by 40%. Dept of Veterans Affairs Missed Appointments &amp; Reminder Gaps Current Situation: Veterans and caregivers receive mixed reminder channels (mail, phone) with inconsistent timing.Problem: Reminder timing and channel misalignment (no SMS/email for many) lead to a 12% no-show rate for specialty care.Actor Effects: Veterans face delayed care; clinics lose capacity; rescheduling backlogs grow.Desired Target Results: Implement multi-channel reminders with caregiver copy; reduce no-shows to \u22646%; reclaim \u226515% of lost clinic capacity within two scheduling cycles. Dept of Veterans Affairs Caregiver Stipend Application Complexity Current Situation: Caregivers apply through a multi-page web form with duplicative questions across programs.Problem: Fragmented intake and unclear eligibility criteria cause 28% abandonment before submission and frequent incomplete applications.Actor Effects: Caregivers spend hours re-entering data; VA teams spend time on outreach and rework; delayed benefits disbursement.Desired Target Results: Consolidate intake with progressive disclosure; cut abandonment to \u226412%; increase complete-on-first-submit to \u226585%; shorten decision time by 20%. Dept of State Wrong Visa Starts by First-Time Travelers Current Situation: Applicants choose visa types via public webpages with dense policy text and PDF links.Problem: Ambiguous eligibility guidance leads 14% of applicants to start the wrong visa path, later abandoning or reapplying.Actor Effects: Applicants incur delays and duplicate fees; consular staff handle corrective inquiries; appointment slots are misallocated.Desired Target Results: Provide an interactive eligibility guide; reduce wrong-start rate to \u22644%; lower abandoned applications by 40%; free up \u226510% appointment capacity. Dept of State DS-160 Session Timeouts &amp; Data Loss Current Situation: Applicants complete the DS-160 online form over low-bandwidth or shared devices.Problem: Inactivity timeouts and unclear save behavior cause form data loss for ~1 in 6 applicants, forcing restarts.Actor Effects: Applicants experience frustration and missed submission windows; support inquiries spike; processing timelines slip.Desired Target Results: Add autosave and clear progress indicators; cut restart incidents by 60%; raise first-session completion to \u226570% without assistance. Dept of State Embassy Appointment Time-Zone Confusion Current Situation: Confirmation emails for biometrics and interviews display local embassy time without explicit time-zone labeling.Problem: Applicants traveling across borders misinterpret times, driving a 9% missed-appointment rate at high-volume posts.Actor Effects: Applicants face travel and lodging rework; posts lose throughput; reschedule queues grow.Desired Target Results: Standardize confirmations with explicit time zone and local conversion link; reduce missed appointments to \u22643%; improve daily slot utilization by \u22658%."},{"location":"content/plays/product/problem-statement-framing/#4-whats-next","title":"4) What's next?","text":"<p>Once you have refined a top list of problems, the next steps to consider are:</p> <ol> <li>Continue performing ongoing assumptions tracking</li> <li>Bring all mission, user and system context together with Impact Mapping, and run solution generation and prioritization exercises.</li> <li>Organize Impact Map conclusions as hypothesis experiments, and leverage problem statements as the basis for framing outcomes on an Outcome-oriented Roadmap </li> </ol>"},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/","title":"Example Product Play","text":""},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#h2-heading","title":"h2 Heading","text":""},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#h3-heading","title":"h3 Heading","text":""},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#h4-heading","title":"h4 Heading","text":""},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#h5-heading","title":"h5 Heading","text":""},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#h6-heading","title":"h6 Heading","text":""},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#typographic-replacements","title":"Typographic replacements","text":"<p>Enable typographer option to see result.</p> <p>(c) (C) (r) (R) (tm) (TM) (p) (P) +-</p> <p>test.. test... test..... test?..... test!....</p> <p>!!!!!! ???? ,,  -- ---</p> <p>\"Smartypants, double quotes\" and 'single quotes'</p>"},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#emphasis","title":"Emphasis","text":"<p>This is bold text</p> <p>This is bold text</p> <p>This is italic text</p> <p>This is italic text</p> <p>~~Strikethrough~~</p>"},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#blockquotes","title":"Blockquotes","text":"<p>Blockquotes can also be nested...</p> <p>...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...</p> <p>...or with spaces between arrows.</p>"},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#lists","title":"Lists","text":"<p>Unordered</p> <ul> <li>Create a list by starting a line with <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, or <code>*</code></li> <li>Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:</li> <li>Marker character change forces new list start:<ul> <li>Ac tristique libero volutpat at</li> <li>Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet</li> <li>Nulla volutpat aliquam velit</li> </ul> </li> <li>Very easy!</li> </ul> <p>Ordered</p> <ol> <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</li> <li>Consectetur adipiscing elit</li> <li> <p>Integer molestie lorem at massa</p> </li> <li> <p>You can use sequential numbers...</p> </li> <li>...or keep all the numbers as <code>1.</code></li> </ol> <p>Start numbering with offset:</p> <ol> <li>foo</li> <li>bar</li> </ol>"},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#horizontal-rules","title":"Horizontal Rules","text":""},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#code","title":"Code","text":"<p>Inline <code>code</code></p> <p>Indented code</p> <pre><code>// Some comments\nline 1 of code\nline 2 of code\nline 3 of code\n</code></pre> <p>Block code \"fences\"</p> <pre><code>Sample text here...\n</code></pre> <p>Syntax highlighting</p> <pre><code>var foo = function (bar) {\n  return bar++;\n};\n\nconsole.log(foo(5));\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"content/plays/product/product-example-play/#tables","title":"Tables","text":"Option Description data path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. engine engine to be used for processing templates.

A story should be easy for all disciplines to understand so the team can align on work to be delivered, and you should not be the one to prescribe specific design or engineering implementations. There are several frameworks for writing stories, but we recommend starting with the INVEST model. Following this method will help you achieve many of the attributes of a successful story.</p> <p>Independent: Aim to have each story be releasable once delivered. Keeping stories independent ensures the application can always be deployed regardless of work completed or not.</p> <p>Negotiable: Be open to making changes to a story based on feedback from your team, both in scope and presentation. </p> <p>Valuable: Each story should communicate some form of added value to the user or product team, even if it is small and incremental.</p> <p>Estimable: A story should be defined enough so the engineering team can easily discuss implementation. Iterate with the team until you can reach this point. If a team cannot point within 5 minutes then it may mean that the story needs clarification. </p> <p>Small:  Always push to keep stories small and get help from your team when breaking down big features. Aim for stories that can be completed in 1 day with the biggest ones taking no more than a week. </p> <p>Testable: A story should have detailed acceptance criteria that will outline the steps you will take to test if the functionality has been added after it has been delivered.

Their engagement ensures that improvements are strategic and aligned with mission objectives.</li> <li>Distinction Between Core and Supportive Value Streams: Both core value streams (directly delivering products or services) and supportive value streams (such as employee onboarding or software delivery) are crucial for overall organizational performance.</li> <li>Data-Driven Analysis: VSM relies on collecting accurate data for process times, lead times, and other metrics that are relevant to your mission/business process to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.</li> <li>Visualization for Clarity: Creating visual maps of processes helps teams understand current workflows, identify inefficiencies, and design improved future states.</li> <li>Iterative Improvement: VSM is not a one-time activity.

To aid in targeting the right level of information, we aim for 5 to 15 serial process blocks.

It just means we need to recalibrate and make sure we make a conscious decision to proceed as is, or make an adjustment. This often prompts the question, \"how do we know when to add a new process block vs. combine them?\".

A federal agency managing benefits might postpone a full-scale migration to a new cloud platform if the testing phase reveals the new system cannot handle the transaction volume of the legacy system. The agency instead opts to continue investing in and maintaining the legacy system to avoid a high-risk failure that would affect citizen services. If a new feature introduces an unacceptable legal or security risk, you may choose not to build it. Mitigate This is the most common strategy and involves taking action to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. When deploying an AI tool for analyzing intelligence data, a defense agency can mitigate the risk of biased outputs by implementing \"human-in-the-loop\" decision support. This ensures a human expert reviews and validates critical decisions made by the AI, reducing the likelihood of erroneous or biased conclusions. If a feature is technically complex, you might allocate extra engineering time to de-risk key integrations or use a phased rollout (canary deployment) to a small user group. Accept This strategy involves understanding and acknowledging a risk and choosing to move forward without taking specific action to address it. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) manages projects to improve disaster response. It must accept the unavoidable risk that a natural disaster (e.g., a new hurricane) may disrupt a recovery project's timeline. This is managed by building adaptable processes, rather than trying to avoid or transfer the risk of a natural disaster itself. This is often the best approach for trivial risks or for risks where the cost of mitigation is too high. Transfer This involves shifting the consequences of a risk to a third party. A federal agency developing a new public-facing service can choose to host its application on an authorized cloud service provider, like those available under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). This transfers the risk of maintaining the underlying IT infrastructure to a vendor that specializes in security and compliance. A company can outsource the development of a complex system to a vendor with specialized expertise, transferring the feasibility risk."},{"location":"content/practices/assumption-risk-management/#2x2-matrix-risk-management","title":"2x2 matrix risk management","text":"<p>If a team prefers to leverage a 2x2 matrix to assess the impact and probability of their risks instead of the formulas provided in the Risk Tracker template, we've provided a helpful guide on how to interpret the quadrant results below.

Here are key practices, drawing from proven methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, to transform your backlog from a source of pain into a powerful engine for delivery:</p> <ul> <li> <p>1.  Create a Single, Prioritized Backlog:</p> <ul> <li>Establish one single backlog as the definitive source of truth for all work your team will undertake.  This eliminates confusion, prevents fragmented efforts, and ensures everyone is working from the same prioritized list.</li> <li>Actionable Steps:<ul> <li>Consolidate existing task lists, spreadsheets, and scattered notes into one backlog.</li> <li>Clearly define what types of items belong in the backlog (features, bugs, tech debt, etc.).</li> <li>Designate a Product Owner (in Scrum) or someone responsible (in Kanban) for backlog ownership and prioritization.</li> <li>Establish a clear distinction for priority within the backlog</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>2.  Prioritize Ruthlessly:</p> <ul> <li>Don't just create a long list \u2013 actively prioritize the backlog, ensuring the most valuable items are at the top and ready to be worked on first.  This is about maximizing value delivery and aligning with your product vision.</li> <li>Actionable Techniques:<ul> <li>Value-Based Prioritization:  Consistently prioritize based on user value, business value, and strategic alignment (as discussed in our article on Ruthless Prioritization). For a detailed guide on backlog prioritization techniques, see our Backlog Prioritization Play.</li> <li>Risk-Based Prioritization:  Prioritize the backlog to test the riskiest assumptions first and begin to generate validated learnings to steer product direction.</li> <li>Use Prioritization Frameworks: Employ techniques like MoSCoW Method, 2x2 matrices, or Story Mapping to structure prioritization discussions and make informed decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>3.  Make Work Visible and Manage Flow:</p> <ul> <li>Visualize your backlog and workflow to enhance transparency and manage flow effectively. Kanban boards are an excellent tool for this, making work progress visible to the entire team and highlighting potential bottlenecks.  A Kanban board without WIP limits is like a highway with no speed limits \u2013 things might look like they are moving fast, but congestion and delays are inevitable.</li> <li>Actionable Techniques:<ul> <li>Implement a Kanban Board:  Use a physical or digital Kanban board (like Jira, Trello, etc.) to visualize your backlog stages (e.g., \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" \"Testing,\" \"Done\"). This visual representation is the foundation for effective flow management.</li> <li>Limit Work In Progress (WIP): This is the core Kanban practice for a reason \u2013 it\u2019s the key to unlocking smooth, efficient flow.  WIP limits are not about restricting productivity; they are about optimizing it. By limiting the number of items that can be \"In Progress\" or \"In Testing\" at any given time, you force the team to finish work before starting more work.  This reduces context switching, encourages collaboration to clear bottlenecks, and dramatically increases overall throughput. </li> <li>Use Swimlanes or Streams of Work:  Categorize backlog items into swimlanes or streams of work (e.g., \"New Features,\" \"Bug Fixes,\" \"Technical Debt\") on your Kanban board to better organize and visualize different types of work. Use Epics, labels, or tags to designate when a new build requires a dependency be completed before it can be started or finished.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>4.  Refine and Groom Your Backlog Regularly:</p> <ul> <li>Treat your backlog as a living document that requires regular maintenance and refinement.  This isn't a one-person job \u2013 it's a team activity, ideally involving Product, developers, design, and stakeholders. </li> <li>Actionable Steps (Backlog Refinement Sessions):<ul> <li>Schedule Regular Refinement Meetings: Dedicate time (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) for backlog refinement sessions, like an IPM (see our Iteration Planning Play).</li> <li>Focus on \"Ready\" Items: In refinement sessions, focus on preparing backlog items that are coming up soon (\"ready for development\").  Break down large items, clarify acceptance criteria, estimate effort, and resolve dependencies.  (For guidance on writing effective user stories to populate your backlog, see our Story Writing Playbook.  For a detailed guide on ensuring stories are \"ready\" for development, see our Interview Discussion Guide Playbook.)</li> <li>\"Right-Size\" User Stories: Break down large epics and features into smaller, more manageable user stories that can be completed within an iteration.</li> <li>Regularly Review and Re-Prioritize: Backlog prioritization isn't a one-time thing. Schedule regular backlog refinement sessions to review priorities, incorporate new information, and adjust as needed.

It's about asking: \"Where can we make the biggest difference?\" and \"What unmet needs can we address that will truly move the needle?\"</p> <p>To bring structure and focus to this process, we can leverage a few helpful approaches and tools.  In this article, we'll explore some practical ways to implement Opportunity Planning, and introduce some frameworks that can be particularly valuable in guiding your efforts.</p> <p>By using Opportunity Planning, we can move beyond simply building features and start strategically crafting solutions that truly resonate with our users and drive significant positive outcomes.</p>"},{"location":"content/practices/opportunity-planning/#why-do-it","title":"Why do it?","text":"<p>Stop building features that might be valuable, and start focusing on opportunities that are guaranteed to be impactful.

When you do this right, you'll find you will:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Focus on Building the Right Things:  Opportunity Planning forces us to deeply understand user needs before we jump to solutions. This drastically reduces the risk of building features that no one actually wants or needs.  By focusing on understanding user needs, we ensure we are solving real problems and creating genuine value, not just building features that seem like a good idea.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make Strategic Decisions and Maximize Impact:  Opportunity Planning provides a framework for evaluating different paths and choosing the ones that align best with our overall mission and strategic goals.  By visualizing the broader impact of our choices, we can prioritize opportunities that will have the greatest positive effect. This strategic focus is crucial for making the most of limited resources and ensuring we're working on things that truly matter.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduce Waste and Improve Efficiency:  By rigorously evaluating opportunities upfront, we can avoid the costly mistake of building features that ultimately don't deliver value. Opportunity Planning helps us identify and discard less promising ideas early in the process, saving significant time, effort, and resources that can then be focused on higher-impact opportunities.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In essence, Opportunity Planning is about being deliberate and strategic.

Instead of just relying on intuition or reacting to the loudest voices, we can use practical approaches to guide our planning.</p> <p>One powerful starting point is to deeply understand your users. Frameworks like Jobs to be Done (JTBD) (Learn More) help us shift our focus from features to understanding the fundamental \"jobs\" users are trying to accomplish.  By asking \"What job is the user hiring our product to do?\", we can uncover unmet needs and identify truly valuable opportunities.  User research methods, as discussed in our article on User Research, are also crucial here, allowing us to gather direct insights and build empathy for our users.</p> <p>Once we have a better grasp of potential opportunities, we need ways to explore and structure our thinking.  Opportunity Solution Trees (Learn More) provide a visual approach to break down broad opportunities into smaller, more manageable chunks, and then brainstorm potential solutions for each. This helps us map out the opportunity space and efficiently evaluate different paths forward.</p> <p>To ensure our opportunity planning is strategically aligned and focused on delivering real impact, Impact Mapping (Learn More) is a valuable collaborative technique.  Impact Mapping helps us connect our product roadmap to broader strategic goals by visualizing the actors involved, the impacts we want to create on those actors, and the deliverables (solutions) that will drive those impacts.  This ensures we are always considering the bigger picture and prioritizing opportunities that contribute to meaningful outcomes.</p> <p>Approaches like the Lean Startup methodology (Learn More) also encourage an iterative and efficient approach to opportunity planning and validation. By embracing build-measure-learn cycles, we can quickly test assumptions, gather feedback, and adapt our plans based on real-world data, ensuring we are continuously refining our understanding of the best opportunities to pursue.</p> <p>Ultimately, \"How to do it?\" for Opportunity Planning is about thoughtfully combining user understanding, structured exploration, strategic alignment, and iterative validation. By incorporating these principles and leveraging frameworks like JTBD, Opportunity Solution Trees, and Impact Mapping (among others), we can move towards a more proactive, user-centric, and impactful approach to product development.</p>"},{"location":"content/practices/opportunity-planning/#relevant-links","title":"Relevant Links","text":"<ul> <li>Impact Mapping</li> <li>Lean Startup methodology</li> <li>Opportunity Solution Trees</li> <li>The Different Styles of Pair Programming - Drovio Blog</li> </ul>"},{"location":"content/practices/outcome-oriented-roadmaps/","title":"Outcome Oriented Roadmaps","text":""},{"location":"content/practices/outcome-oriented-roadmaps/#what-is-it","title":"What is it?","text":"<p>A strategy communication tool that highlights prioritized experiments with expected outcomes and mission/business impacts.
