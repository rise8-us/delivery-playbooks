## üìö What is Impact Mapping?
Impact Mapping is a strategic planning and alignment technique designed to help teams visualize the cause-and-effect relationship between the outcomes they aim to achieve and the deliverables they plan to build. It creates a shared understanding among cross-functional teams about what will drive meaningful mission or business impact.

At Rise8, we use Impact Mapping to:
- Align work with measurable **Business/Mission Impact**
- Facilitate strategic conversations with stakeholders
- Prioritize deliverables that create real change
- Avoid building outputs that don't serve user or mission needs

Our modified canvas includes four key dimensions:
- **Business / Mission Impact** (formerly ‚ÄúGoal‚Äù)
- **Actors** (who can influence outcomes)
- **Outcomes** (behaviors we want to change)
- **Deliverables** (what we might build)

## üéØ Why It's Valuable
Impact Mapping helps teams avoid the **feature factory trap** by focusing on what needs to change, for whom, and why. It's a natural complement to:
- **Value Stream Mapping**, which shows how value currently flows (or doesn‚Äôt)
- **OKRs**, which define the measurable goals we‚Äôre aiming for
- **Event Storming**, which models domain events and interactions

When used correctly, Impact Maps:
- Uncover hidden assumptions
- Clarify intent before jumping to solutions
- Strengthen outcome-first thinking
- Improve stakeholder alignment

## üîç Related Frameworks: When and Why to Use Each
| Framework | Focus | When to Use |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Impact Mapping** | Behavioral change linked to mission/business goals | When you want to connect deliverables to measurable impact |
| **Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)** | Exploration of solution space for a given outcome | When the outcome is clear and you're identifying/validating multiple options |
| **OKRs** | Goal-setting and measurement | When you need a quarterly mission-aligned target with key results |
| **North Star Framework** | Product strategy and leading indicator alignment | When you need a singular guiding metric and supporting inputs |
| **JTBD** | Understanding customer motivations and context | When you need deep user insight for innovation or feature framing |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisite: Have a Clear Impact Target
Before running an Impact Mapping exercise:
- Confirm that your team has a clearly defined and **quantified Business/Mission Impact** target or an OKR
- Without this, you risk generating a list of disconnected activities with no clear prioritization logic

If you don‚Äôt have this yet:
- Start with an OKR workshop or Value Stream Mapping to clarify mission impact opportunities
- Use those outputs to anchor your Impact Map

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Facilitate an Impact Mapping Session

### üß∞ Prep Checklist
| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Canvas | Use Rise8‚Äôs custom layout: **Impact ‚Üí Actors ‚Üí Outcomes ‚Üí Deliverables** |
| Facilitator | One lead facilitator to guide the session and prompt critical thinking |
| Participants | Balanced team members (Product, Design, Engineering) + Key stakeholders |
| Context Brief | Background material on problem space, relevant data, and mission objectives |
| Timer | To time-box each mapping phase and ensure momentum |
| Whiteboarding Tool | Miro, Mural, Jamboard, or physical whiteboard with sticky notes |

### üß≠ Facilitation Steps

1. **Frame the Mission Impact**
   - Revisit the OKR or quantified impact you‚Äôre targeting
   - Write this at the top of the canvas under **Business / Mission Impact**
   - Ensure shared clarity across all participants

2. **Identify Actors**
   - Who can enable or block this impact?
   - Consider internal roles, external users, partners, and regulators
   - Capture each actor in the second column

3. **Define Behavioral Outcomes**
   - For each actor, what specific behavior must change?
   - Use the format: _"We need [actor] to [do something differently]"
   - Focus on behavior, not sentiment

4. **Brainstorm Potential Deliverables**
   - What could we build to influence these behaviors?
   - List multiple options per outcome ‚Äî don‚Äôt filter too early
   - Use this moment to provoke critical conversations ("Will this actually cause the behavior change?")

5. **Cluster and Prioritize**
   - Group deliverables that support the same outcome
   - Assess risk vs impact to focus efforts
   - Use dot voting or effort-impact mapping if needed

### üí° Tips for Better Output
- Encourage divergent thinking early, then converge later
- Keep the language behavioral and concrete
- Use data or anecdotes to challenge assumptions
- Ask "If we build this, why do we believe it will cause that outcome?"

### üö´ Common Pitfalls to Avoid
| Pitfall | How to Avoid It |
|--------|------------------|
| Jumping straight to deliverables | Force conversation to stay in Outcomes layer until well-explored |
| Vague impact statements | Quantify impact ‚Äî don‚Äôt settle for "improve UX" or "streamline workflow" |
| Overloading the map | Limit deliverables to high-impact bets, not every possible idea |
| Groupthink | Actively invite dissenting views to expose blind spots |

## ‚úÖ After the Session: What‚Äôs Next?
- Synthesize the output into a cleaned-up map
- Highlight any assumptions or validation needs
- Connect prioritized deliverables to OKRs and Roadmaps
- Use the map in stakeholder conversations to justify choices
