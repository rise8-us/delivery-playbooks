# Problem Statement Framing

> Step-by-step guidance to synthesizing, refining and prioritizing problem statements

## 1) Identify and contextualize the problem

The first step in writing a problem statement is to spot the issue, and start gathering data. Step into the environment where the problem happens—whether in support, production, or somewhere else—and try to experience it firsthand. Begin to connect how this problem currently effects the mission or business.

After seeing the problem for yourself, talk to the people closest to it. That might include support teams, cross-functional partners, or anyone with hands-on documentation. Additionally, leverage user and stakeholder research to also map out the full scope of the problem.

1. What is the problem?
2. What symptoms do we notice about the problem space?
3. How have we tried to solve this problem before? Why didn't that work?
4. What assumptions and biases surround this problem?
5. What do we know to be true about this problem? What data do we have on hand?
6. Who experiences the problem?
7. When, where and how do they experience it?
8. What consequences are produced by the problem?
9. How do individual lived experiences alter those current outcomes?
10. How does this measurably impact the mission/business today?

## 2) Find the root cause

This is the opportunity to really dig into the "why" questions behind the issue to identify its origin point. To do this we can execute a number of other practices and plays to uncover root cause context that will help us refine our problem statements.

### Root cause methods

#### Qualitative and conversational

* [**5 Whys**](https://delivery-playbooks.rise8.us/content/plays/cross-discipline/5-whys/) A simple but powerful technique where you repeatedly ask "why" to dig deeper into a problem.
* [**User interviews**](https://delivery-playbooks.rise8.us/content/plays/design/interview-discussion-guide/): One-on-one conversations with users allow you to explore their experiences, needs, and motivations in depth. The open-ended nature of interviews helps uncover pain points that users might not be consciously aware of or articulate in a survey.
* **Focus groups**: While not for deep root cause discovery, focus groups can be used in the early stages of a project to brainstorm and explore a problem space.

#### Observational and analytical

* [**Value Stream Mapping**](https://delivery-playbooks.rise8.us/content/plays/product/value-stream-mapping/): A Lean tool used to visualize the flow of work, materials, and information needed to deliver value to a customer—from request to delivery.
* [**Usability testing**](https://delivery-playbooks.rise8.us/content/practices/user-research/#usability-testing): Observe users as they attempt to complete specific tasks. Researchers can see exactly where users get stuck, make mistakes, or become confused. Asking users to "think aloud" during the process can provide the "why" behind their behavior.
* [**Accessibility testing**](https://delivery-playbooks.rise8.us/content/practices/user-research/#accessibility-testing): Accessibility testing is the practice of ensuring your product is usable to as many people as possible, including those with visual impairments, hearing disabilities, and other physical or cognitive conditions.
* **User session recordings**: Tools that record real users' screens as they interact with your product can visually reveal usability issues and points of friction. You can watch their actual behavior rather than just relying on what they say they do.
* **Analytics and heatmaps**: Quantitative analytics tools that track user or system behavior at a macro or micro level.
* [**Data and metrics collection**](https://delivery-playbooks.rise8.us/content/practices/data-and-metrics-collection/): Data & Metrics Collection is the disciplined way we capture, govern, and interpret evidence to learn/validate whether our products, services or even delivery processes are achieving the desired outcomes, and improving the mission.

#### Framework-based
* [**Journey mapping**](https://delivery-playbooks.rise8.us/content/plays/design/journey-mapping/): This visualization of the end-to-end user experience, including all touchpoints and emotional states, can highlight specific pain points and opportunities for improvement along the way.
* [**Service Blueprint mapping**](https://delivery-playbooks.rise8.us/content/plays/design/service-blueprint/): A user research technique that creates a visual diagram of an entire service, showing the customer experience alongside the internal processes that support it, including front-stage interactions, backstage employee actions, and underlying support systems. 
* **Affinity diagramming**: A collaborative process where a team groups similar observations and ideas from research into clusters. This method helps to synthesize qualitative data and identify common themes that point toward underlying root causes.
* [**DDD Event Storming**](https://delivery-playbooks.rise8.us/content/plays/engineering/DDD-Eventstorm/): serves as a highly collaborative workshop integral to Domain-Driven Design, facilitating the rapid discovery and exploration of a domain's core business processes.

## 3) Refine problem statements

The following templates will ensure problem statements are specifc, actor-focused (e.g. users, stakeholder or systems), and aligned to results that matter.

### Wholistic and thourough approach

* **I am a** *[persona of interest; could be users, stakeholders, services or even entire systems].*
* **I'm trying to** *[accomplish a task, job-to-be-done, goal],*
* **but** *[the problem or challenge they're experiencing]*
* **because** *[the root cause to our problem/challenge]*
* **which makes me feel** *[emotion/sentiment]*
* **and contributes to** *[current mission/business impact condition].*

| Developer Platforms      | OAuth onboarding & docs                          | I am a partner developer integrating OAuth 2.0. I’m trying to complete authentication and make my first successful API call, but I keep receiving token errors and 4xx responses on day one because the quickstart examples are inconsistent across languages and the doc flow buries required parameters. Which makes me feel frustrated and uncertain, and contributes to delayed integrations, higher support ticket volume, and early churn risk. |
| Developer Platforms      | FedRAMP/ATO-friendly CI                          | I am a federal platform engineer. I’m trying to pass security scans in CI to move toward ATO, but my builds fail on approved runners because there are no STIG-hardened base images or signed SBOMs available. Which makes me feel blocked and anxious about compliance timelines, and contributes to missed delivery milestones and stalled accreditation.                                                                                           |
| Developer Platforms      | Webhooks reliability in sandbox                  | I am a backend engineer. I’m trying to validate webhooks end-to-end before production, but I can’t reliably replay events because the platform sandbox lacks message retry and an easy tunnel for local testing. Which makes me feel nervous about hidden failure modes, and contributes to production rollbacks and longer incident MTTR.                                                                                                            |
| Developer Platforms      | Quotas & rate limits                             | I am an API consumer on a new team. I’m trying to achieve time-to-first-2xx under 30 minutes, but I keep hitting rate limits unexpectedly because default quotas and 429 guidance are undocumented in the quickstart. Which makes me feel confused and stuck, and contributes to false incident escalations and wasted engineering time.                                                                                                              |
| Developer Platforms      | Cross-SDK observability                          | I am an SRE on call. I’m trying to triage an incident quickly, but traces and metrics are inconsistent across official SDKs because they ship different OpenTelemetry versions and naming conventions. Which makes me feel blind during outages, and contributes to longer MTTR and SLO breaches.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Dept of Veterans Affairs | Post-discharge enrollment                        | I am a recently discharged Veteran. I’m trying to enroll in primary care and benefits, but I have to re-enter the same information across multiple portals because systems aren’t integrated for identity and data reuse. Which makes me feel exhausted and discouraged, and contributes to delayed access to care and increased no-shows.                                                                                                            |
| Dept of Veterans Affairs | Caregiver respite scheduling                     | I am a family caregiver. I’m trying to schedule respite care, but appointment availability is a black box because clinic calendars and eligibility checks aren’t synchronized. Which makes me feel helpless and burned out, and contributes to missed appointments and avoidable emergency visits.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Dept of Veterans Affairs | Claims intake system (system persona)            | I am the claims intake system. I’m trying to accept complete submissions the first time, but I receive duplicate and abandoned forms because session timeouts are aggressive and progress saving is unclear.
