# Problem Statement Framing

> A set of practical approaches that lead to more predictable changes in user/system behavior and greater mission impact

## What are problem statements?

A problem statement is a clear, concise, and focused description of an issue that could be solved, serving as a critical alignment tool for delivery teams and a guide for solution exploration. Mastering problem statements prevents misunderstandings, ensures everyone is working towards the same goal, and focuses delivery efforts on the right challenge for users, systems and the mission, leading to greater chances for overall success. An effective problem statement is clear, specific, identifies the affected actors, details the impact, and establishes the desired result.

### Why getting problem statements is important

* **Alignment & Focus**: It ensures the entire team understands and prioritizes a specific problem to solve.
* **Prevents Wasted Effort**: Unclear problem statements lead teams into building solutions for the wrong issue, - wasting time and resources.
* **Guides Solution Exploration**: A well-crafted problem statement acts as a roadmap, keeping delivery efforts targeted and relevant to the actual problem.
* **Measurable Success**: Sets objective-based success criteria, allowing delivery teams to verify we've effectively addressed the original problem.

### What makes an effective problem statement?

An effective problem statement includes the following key components: 

* **The Problem**: A clear, unambiguous description of the issue or unmet need.
* **The Context**: Background information to give the problem meaning and explain why it's an issue now.
* **Who/What it Affects**: Identifying the specific users or systems impacted by the problem.
* **Measurability**: Empowers delivery teams to set benchmarks and track progress towards a target, guiding the effectiveness of proposed solutions.
* **Clarity & Conciseness**: It should be simple enough for anyone to understand on the first read, avoiding jargon and fluff.
* **Specificity**: Providing concrete details about the problem's scope rather than being vague or broad.
* **Objectivity**: Presenting the facts about the problem without introducing bias, and avoiding any mention of a presupposed solution.
