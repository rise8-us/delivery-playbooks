# Practice Management

## What is it?

Practice Management are capabilities that focus on *People and Promotion of Delivery Practices* for an organization typically owned by a Practice Leadership team. Practice Management works best in conjunction with [Portfolio Management](../portfolio-management) where Portfolio Management capabilities focus on Products, Pipeline, and Path to Production. Phrased differently, Practice Management focuses on the craft, or, the “how” and “why” to the approach of building software. Portfolio Management focuses on the “what” and “why” of the software that is built.

Practice Management focuses on servicing the needs of practitioners in an organization. Practice Leads develop practitioners to have the skill sets needed to deliver outcomes quickly and efficiently. Practice Leads are zealots and promote the delivery practices to candidates for future hiring, partners, stakeholders, and potential customers.

Practice Management (and Portfolio Management) should be thought of as groupings of capabilities which must be custom-tailored to the exact needs of an organization so that the when creating roles to focus on capabilities, it is shaped in a way that integrates into existing leadership functions and addresses the biggest organizational bottlenecks.

Typically the Practice Leadership function is a small balanced team within a much larger organization, so they focus on putting structures in place where they can have a valuable impact on a one-to-many scale. The Practice Leadership team should have a balanced mixture of disciplines represented that mirror the teams in the delivery organization such as Design, Product Management and Engineering. Practice Leads align together on strategies and initiatives but then may break off to work with their own craft when it comes to discipline-specific activities.

### People Focused Capabilities

## Why do it?

In order to build a successful “innovation lab”, you need a culture where practitioners are constantly thinking about how to grow and evolve their craft to stay on the cutting edge. This ensures people-focused continuous improvement practices are in place within the organization so that our skills and competencies are always growing and evolving alongside our industry. In the same way we establish continuous improvement feedback cycles for products, this people-focused approach ensures talent is always growing and skillsets don’t become obsolete. The promotion side of Practice Management sets the practice up for better fit hiring candidates and better fit customers leading to greater chances for successfully delivering outcomes.

## Practice & Portfolio Management in Tandem

Practice & Portfolio Leadership teams work closely together to deliver outcomes.

Practice Leads focus on servicing the needs of all practitioners and cultivating healthy communities of practice. They develop practitioners to have the skill sets needed to be successful on projects.

Portfolio Leads focus on servicing the needs of the customer through delivery of outcomes. They ensure teams are moving in the right direction together.

Practice & Portfolio roles create a clear division of capabilities when both exist in an organization. If one role exists without the other, the capabilities become more homogeneous across Practice & Portfolio. Responsibilities and focus should reflect the current needs of the organization.
